# Main Controller
Imitating an Oculus Quest Touch controller with button layout and system. Occasionally nicknamed "Mainline Controller", "Main Controller", "Basic Controller", etc.

# Motion Controller
For Beatsaber and other games where buttons arenâ€™t as important. Occasionally nicknamed "Minimalist Controller", "Minimalist Motion Controller", "Beatsaber Controller", etc.

- Focused simply on very accurate and low-latency positional and rotational tracking
- Only has trigger and system button

Potential "snap-on" detatchable batteries?

# Grip-Button Controller
Essentially imitating the Main Controller, but with three grip triggers rather than one. I don't know what to nickname this.

This is designed in hopes to track individual fingers through explicit grip button presses (as to mitigate calibration issues).

- Three individual finger grip triggers
- A+B buttons
- System Button
- Joystick
- Trigger

Potential "snap-on" extra finger grip buttons?

# Pro Controller
Many many buttons, joysticks, switches, and scroll wheels. Occasionally nicknamed "Live Performer Controller", "Livestreamer Controller", "MMO Controller", etc.

The idea is that the extra buttons may provide additional functionality without overwriting buttonmaps with existing games. For example, functions such as OVR Advanced Settings Space Drag, Speech-to-Text-to-Speech generation, and various overlay toggles may have their own button mapped configuration. Additionally, there may exist, theoretically, the ability to trigger various VRChat animations with detecting button presses and mapping this through OSC. If this were available, it should also work similarly for other games with similar functionality (such as Resonite, etc.). Essentially, if one were to describe this class of controller, it would be an MMO Mouse , or perhaps even have the ability (through software) to be classified as a Stream Deck of VR controllers.
