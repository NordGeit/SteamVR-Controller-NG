I stumbled upon this git repo and I want in :3 

So basically, what I have over here is a couple of etee controllers and thus I have the access to the way etee did

And basically :3

The controllers are all separate from the trackers :3

So here is an alternate way to look at things:

How do we get a wireless controller to be recognized in SteamVR?

Could be anything at first :3

okay I'm gonna

## Okay, so.

In a more serious note, I have realized that, due to etee's willingness to support other trackers than just their own, they've worked it so that the controllers themselves are considered separate from the trackers.

They do use the same dongle to connect them all, might actually prove to be part of the issue here, but I digress.

Essentially, when you connect the controllers to the trackers, all it really does is to provide a charge for the trackers, it seems, unless they're etee's. Might want to re-check that, but a couple of plonks of varying economic affluence, both low-class, can not easily afford the 2000Â£ evaluation kit that would allow us to dive a little further into etee's APIs and whatnot.

What this DOES open up, however, is the possibility of making our lives a little easier.
