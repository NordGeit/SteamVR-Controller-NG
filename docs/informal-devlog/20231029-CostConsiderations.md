# A note on the product cost

Currently, this project is in very early stages, perhaps way too early to provide any cost estimates on a per-controller or per-unit (one unit being left and right controllers) basis. However, from just an early DIY state, I could definitely tell that one of the highest cost components of this system, as I see it now, is the tracking and watchman 2.4GHz protocol. This is due to the fact that very few companies have access, let alone experience, with these two pieces.

However, using something like a Tundra Tracker, Vive 3.0 Tracker, or Vive Wand controller for the basis of tracking could mitigate a lot of potential annoyances of working with a fully custom Lighthouse Tracking and Watchman system. Since much of this is either proprietary (and developing for it may require either reverse engineering or reaching out to subject matter experts in various companies for insight) or simply too complex for the scope of a DIY process, I believe it may be worth using existing systems for a first-pass.

Eventually, it may be worth reaching out to companies for further insight, either for a more closed-source process and developing a product to sell, or to help document existing processes that are not yet open source due to the fact that much of the information exists in tacit knowledge rather than appropriately documented. Regardless, I have two branches being developed in my mind now:

1. Open source DIY-able controller
    - Appropriate variants documented, guides written, and files available
2. Sellable custom controller
    - Potentially with two variants: main-line and pro-line

In terms of cost, if I were to give an estimate for DIY at this current point in time (and I can be very wrong in this estimation), I would guess it to be around $175-200 per controller, depending on the source of your tracker. I was able to find a Vive 3.0 tracker for a little less than $75 (ended up being less than $80 all told) on eBay, however this price is definitely not consistent by any means. That being said, if a tracker can be sourced by other means or subsidized, the rest of the controller (excluding the tracker) may cost up to about $50-100, depending on part choice. Of course, this is a conservative guess, I'm hoping it'll be much cheaper than that.

In terms of cost for the end-product that'll hopefully be sellable (for those who perhaps want a once-and-done purchase instead of DIY'ing their own), I'm hoping to get the cost down to as low as $250 or less per pair of main-line controllers, and would be ambitious to have the price be around $180 per pair. Of course, at that point, it would very much depend on volume, build quality, and other potential factors that come with actually shipping a product.

I can't give an estimate for the pro-line controller though, since that's still not even fully ideated and designed, but I'm hoping to get the pair to be less than $450.
