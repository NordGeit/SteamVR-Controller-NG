# Current Tasks List

As a means to bring more motivation to this project, I've been working to ensure I have proper financial stability and appropriate, responsible funding budgeted toward this project. As such, I would be able to figure out a means to continue working on things here while not worrying about whether I'd have enough money allocated to the project, etc. (all before external support through Ko-Fi, Patreon, or other sources).

In addition to motivation, I decided it may be a good idea to have a bit more of a detailed plan for the short term and see how many tasks I can check off. Due to the fact that I'm rather unfamiliar with GitHub project management, what I've got working for me would be markdown and text files, so I might as well utilize these to the best of my ability for project and task management.

My current goal for the short term (as seen in [Project Milestones](/README.md#project-milestones)) is to have a Frankenstein-modded controller in a DIY-able state (with documentation, guides, and best practices known) by the end of the calendar year. With today being the 20th of October, I believe the timeline of approximately two and a quarter months should be *reasonable enough* for the most part (however, things may change suddenly).

## Tasks for Milestone 1:

- [ ] Order Vive Wand controllers (2018 version)
- [ ] Disassemble controllers and understand internal parts
- [ ] Investigate the capabilities of existing internal parts
    - Can extra sensors, buttons, etc. be attached?
    - Can the firmware be flashed with some new code?
    - To what extent could these controllers be reverse engineered?
- [ ] Design new controller layout and enclosure based on existing components
- [ ] Build new controller layout, test, and validate
- [ ] Bring to a DIY-reproduceable state
    - Documentation and guides written, will be accepting feedback based on DIY'ed builds
