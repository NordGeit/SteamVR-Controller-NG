- Focused simply on very accurate and low-latency positional and rotational tracking
- Only has trigger and system button

# Individual Finger Controller

Potential "snap-on" extra finger grip buttons?

# Live Performer Controller
Many many buttons, joysticks, switches, and scroll wheels. The idea is that the extra buttons may provide additional functionality without overwriting buttonmaps with existing games. For instance, OVR Advanced Settings Space Drag may have its own configuration. Additionally, there may exist, theoretically, the ability to trigger various VRChat animations with detecting button presses and mapping this through OSC. If this were available, it should also work similarly for other games with similar functionality (such as Resonite, etc.).
