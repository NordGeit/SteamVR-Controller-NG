# SteamVR-Controller
Repository for building a DIY Lighthouse VR controller

## Current project status (subject to change... a lot):
- [ ] **Ideation**
- [ ] Research
- [ ] Pre-Design
    - [ ] Proof of concept
        - Electrical components mapped out, components fit together in some way, etc.
        - Firmware design identified
        - Minimum viable product documented
    - [ ] Ideation for alternatives, spin-offs, and other designs
- [ ] Design and Manufacturing
- [ ] Replication and Testing
- [ ] Bug squashing
- [ ] Evaluation and Iteration

## Project goals:
- Create a framework for which general users with some technical knowledge can build their own SteamVR lighthouse tracked hand-held controllers from widely available and easily sourceable components
    - Controller must have feature parity or parity plus with existing mainstream VR controllers. This may include (but may not be limited to) the following functions:
        - Low latency, high accuracy 6DoF tracking
        - Button mapping
            - A
            - B
            - Joystick (Hall-effect compatibility)
            - System (SteamVR menu)
            - Grip (analogue value)
            - Trigger (analogue value)
        - Capacitive touch sensing availability
            - A, B, Joystick
- Ensure compatibility and useability with existing SteamVR-native utilities
